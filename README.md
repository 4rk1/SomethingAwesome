Hi, I 've created a series of CTF-style challenges as part of my Something Awesome project for COMP6841 at UNSW.
The aim of these challenges were to provide an introduction to some common concepts in cybersecurity.

First of all, I decided to explore Buffer Overflow Attacks.
You can read about them here: [Buffer Overflow](https://github.com/4rk1/SomethingAwesome/blob/main/Buffer%20Overflow.pdf)

Challenge 1:\
Download the files [bo_challenge1](https://github.com/4rk1/SomethingAwesome/blob/main/bo_challenge1) and [bo_challenge1_redacted.c](https://github.com/4rk1/SomethingAwesome/blob/main/bo_challenge1_redacted.c), can you find the vulnerability in the program?

Challenge 2:\
You've received information that the meaning of life is hidden somewhere within the program **[bo_challenge2_redacted.c]**. 
You've also managed to gain access to the source code **[bo_challenge]**. Can you find the secret to achieve
inner peace?

Next up I wanted to discuss cryptography and briefly look at its evolution from ancient times to the comforting security
it can provide today: [Cryptography](https://github.com/4rk1/SomethingAwesome/blob/main/Cryptography.pdf)

Challenge 3:\
It's week 7, you have had to take on all the work in your COMP1531 group project since all your teammates are useless. You're not
sure if you're going to have time to do the wargame for COMP6841 this week, so you get an idea. You intercept a conversation
**[merkle_puzzle]** containing this week's flag, but you find that it's encrypted. Can you decode the message?

Challenge 4:\
The stress from COMP1531 has ruined you. You decide to take a gap year and visit South Africa. You're having a great time, but
then you realise you've forgotten your password to your bank account. Can you navigate the bank's confusing password reset
system **[rsa]** to get a new password and continue your trip?

Finally I was intrigued by hashing. I know that it is a type of cryptography, but I felt that it deserved it's own section.
I've given a brief explanation of what it is and some basic attacks: [Hashing](https://github.com/4rk1/SomethingAwesome/blob/main/Hashing.pdf)

Challenge 5:\
There's only an hour until it's due but you've finally finished the Something Awesome project for COMP6841. You go to submit it
to Moodle, only to discover that you've forgotten your password (again? You really have the memory of a goldfish...). You know
that you've stored it in your password manager **[the_final_challenge]**, but you remember that you've installed some
protections just in case. This project is worth 30% and you can't afford to be late, can you figure out the password in time?
